Big-box retailers like Ikea are shifting towards smaller format stores to provide a more personalized shopping experience and increase revenue per square foot. Target, Macy's, Nordstrom, and Walmart have also experimented with smaller stores in recent years. Data shows that these smaller formats can attract a more affluent demographic and cater to changing consumer preferences. Retail experts believe that the trend towards smaller stores is driven by the shift to online shopping and the desire to optimize revenue in physical stores. Customers have mixed opinions on the effectiveness of smaller stores, with some preferring the selection of larger stores. Retailers are adapting to consumer demand for convenience and variety by offering different store formats and experimenting with new ways to engage with customers.
